as-container provides some utils such as `Option` and `Result` inspired by Rust for other people to use.

## Example

```typescript
const x = Option.Some("some");
expect(x.map<string>((s) => s + s).unwrap()).toBe("somesome");
```

More examples can be found in [unit tests](./assembly/__tests__/option.spec.ts)
